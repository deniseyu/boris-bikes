# Learning Objectives

### Object-Oriented Design
We started this project by creating Class Responsibility Cards (CRCs) to identify the objects that needed to be created and which responsibilities each object would have.

### Test-Driven Development
In this iteration of Boris Bikes, we used Chicago-style testing throughout the test suite, written in RSpec.

### Composition & Inheritance
We employed modular composition principles when refactoring the BikeContainer methods into a module that is mixed into Docking Station, Garage, and Van. In this project, the design of the system did not call for inheritance.
